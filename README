A "toy" implementation of the Huffman compression algorithm
==============================================================
I wrote this program as an exercise for learning Ruby. I had 
previously written a similar program in Python.


The input string is for the moment fixed as "aaabccdeeeeeffg"

The program is executed using the command:
  
   ruby huffman.rb

we get the encoded bit pattern of the input string and
the original string as the output.
